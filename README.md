# PScripts

Simple PowerShell scripts to automate some administrative tasks and make our life easier (hopefully).

## Get-Apps

This cmdlet enumerates the applications installed in your system, from different sources, and return an ugly list (to improve),
with the fields `Name`, `Version` and `Vendor`.

It can also return the list in CSV format.
